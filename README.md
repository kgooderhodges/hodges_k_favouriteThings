# Favourite Things App
An application that shows three of my favourite things. This app was designed to show the ease of pulling information from a database, instead of stored within the site. Once you click the image, data that displays the name and description will become visible.

## Project for Interactive Media Design - Multimedia Authoring 3.
To make the project work you will need to have tbl_fav_things in your database.

## Built with:
HTML, CSS, JS, SASS, Ajax, PHP
